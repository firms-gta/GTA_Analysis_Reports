## Catches on land {-}

### Purse seine and baitboat geo-referenced catch data set by month and 1°x1° grid area

Some of the geo-referenced catches available from IATTC, ICCAT, and IOTC are located on land (**Table \@ref(tab:MislocationLandCAPSBB11MTable)** and **Fig. \@ref(fig:barplot)**).

```{r tab.cap = "Summary of total catch from the purse seine and baitboat geo-referenced catch data set by month and 1°x1° grid area that are associated with grid squares located on land", tab.id = "MislocationLandCAPSBB11MTable"}
CA_PS_BB_11M_ON_LAND_RFMO_UNIT_FT = 
  CA_PS_BB_11M_ON_LAND_RFMO_UNIT %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::font(fontname = "calibri", part = c("all")) %>% 
  align(part = "header", align = "center") %>% 
  colformat_double(digits = 0) %>%
  fontsize(size = 9) %>% 
  border_inner() %>% 
  border_outer(border = fp_border(width = 2)) %>% 
  merge_v(j = "RFMO") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  fix_border_issues()

CA_PS_BB_11M_ON_LAND_RFMO_UNIT_FT
```

```{r MislocationLandCA_PS_BB_11MMap, fig.cap = "Distribution of catches from the geo-referenced catch data set by month and 1°x1° grid area. (a) catches reported in metric tonnes; (b) catches reported in numbers of fish", fig.id = "barplot"}

```

### Geo-referenced catch data set by month and 5°x5° grid area

```{r tab.cap = "Summary of total catch from the geo-referenced catch data set by month and 5°x5° grid area that are associated with grid squares located on land", tab.id = "MislocationLandCA55MTable"}
