### Purse seine and baitboat geo-referenced catch data set by month and 1°x1° grid area

Some of the geo-referenced catches available from IATTC, ICCAT, and IOTC are located on land (**Table \@ref(tab:MislocationLandCAPSBB11MTable)** and **Fig. \@ref(fig:barplot)**).


```{r tab.cap = "Summary of total catch from the purse seine and baitboat geo-referenced catch data set by month and 1°x1° grid area that are associated with grid squares located on land", tab.id = "MislocationLandCAPSBB11MTable"}

### Geo-referenced catch data set by month and 5°x5° grid area

### Geo-referenced catch data set by time series

#### Geo-referenced catch data set by month 

```{r timeseriesmislocated, fig.cap = "Time series of catches from the geo-referenced catch data located on land set by month", fig.id = "timeseriesmislocated"}

### Repartition of factors for data on land

## Catches outside juridiction zone {-}

### Catches outside every juridiction zone


```{r CA_WITH_NO_COMPETENCE_AREA, fig.cap = "Reported captures on CWP grids being in none of the 4 competence areas", fig.id = "CA_WITH_NO_COMPETENCE_AREA"}

include_graphics(paste0(here(),"/outputs/charts/mislocation/CA_WITH_NO_COMPETENCE_AREA.png"))

```




```{r tab.cap = "Summary of total catch from the geo-referenced catch data set by month and 5°x5° grid area that are associated with grid squares located outside of the 4 competences areas", tab.id = "SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY"}

library(readxl)
SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY <- read_excel(here("outputs/datasets/SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY.xlsx"))

SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY = 
  SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY %>%
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::font(fontname = "calibri", part = c("all")) %>% 
  align(part = "header", align = "center") %>% 
  colformat_double(digits = 0) %>%
  fontsize(size = 9) %>% 
  border_inner() %>% 
  border_outer(border = fp_border(width = 2)) %>% 
  merge_v(j = "RFMO") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  fix_border_issues()

SUM_ALL_GRIDS_WIHOUT_COMPETENCE_AREA_SUMMARY
```

This does not concern a lot of data and most of the cwp grid are only a bit outside a continent.

## Catches outside declarant juridiction zone

```{r}
CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA <- read_excel(here("outputs/datasets/CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA.xlsx"))
```


```{r tab.cap = "Summary of total catch from the geo-referenced catch data that are associated with grid squares located outside of the competences area of the declarant", tab.id = "CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA"}


CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA_DF = 
  CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA %>%distinct() %>% 
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::font(fontname = "calibri", part = c("all")) %>% 
  align(part = "header", align = "center") %>% 
  colformat_double(digits = 0) %>%

  merge_v(j = "RFMO") %>% 
  autofit() %>%

CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA_DF
```

This concerns a few square for 3 tRFMOs.

```{r CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA_OF_DECLARANT, fig.cap = "Reported captures on CWP grids being outside the competence zone of the declarant", fig.id = "CA_OUTSIDE_COMPETENCE_AREA_OF_DECLARANT"}
