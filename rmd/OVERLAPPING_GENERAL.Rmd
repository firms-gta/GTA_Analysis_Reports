# Grids single declared in overlapping zones

```{r CA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONES_MAP, fig.cap = "Distribution of catches in overlapping zones", fig.id = "barplot"}

include_graphics(here("outputs/charts/overlapping/CA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONES_MAP.png"))

```


```{r CA_GRID_DOUBLE_DECLARATIONS_MAP, fig.cap = "Distribution of grids in overlapping zones having double declarations", fig.id = "barplot"}

include_graphics(here("outputs/charts/overlapping/CA_GRID_DOUBLE_DECLARATIONS_MAP.png"))

```

Only a few of grids in several juridictions zones have actually declarations for multiple tRFMOs.


```{r fig.cap = "Distribution of grids in overlapping zones having only records from one tRFMO (all 1 deg square aggregated in 5 deg)", fig.id = "barplot"}

include_graphics(here("outputs/charts/overlapping/DATA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONE_NOT_WITH_DOUBLE_DECLARATION_MAP.png"))

```

To be noted that the only 10x10 grid in the overlapping zone has declaration only from one tRFMO. 

The data recorded on those grids should be kept as it is recorded, even if it is contained in overlapping zone.

For the remaining of the document we present the overlapping zone between IOTC and WCPFC, IATTC and WCPFC and for the Southern Bluefin Tuna captures.
