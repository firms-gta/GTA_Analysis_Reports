```{r CA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONES_MAP, fig.cap = "Distribution of catches in overlapping zones", fig.id = "barplot"}

include_graphics(here("outputs/charts/overlapping/CA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONES_MAP.png"))

```

Only a few of grids in several juridictions zones have actually declarations for multiple tRFMOs.


```{r fig.cap = "Distribution of grids in overlapping zones having only records from one tRFMO (all 1 deg square aggregated in 5 deg)", fig.id = "barplot"}

include_graphics(here("outputs/charts/overlapping/DATA_IN_OVERLAPPING_ZONE_NOT_WITH_DOUBLE_DECLARATION_MAP.png"))

```

The data recorded on those grids should be kept as it is recorded, even if it is contained in overlapping zone


# Grids double declared in overlapping zones

```{r child='Overlapping IATTC _ WCPFC.Rmd'}

```
