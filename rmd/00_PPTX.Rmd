# Purpose

# Summary of fishery trends by fishery group

### Industrial purse seines

  - Catches generally stable in the last five years
  - Recent peak identified in 2021 (**SYC** and **EU,France** LS)
  - Highly variable trends in catches on free-school
  - Free-school peak identified for **EU,Spain** in 2021
  
### Industrial longlines

  - Decrease in catches until 2018, increasing until 2020 (deep freezing LL from **TWN**, **SYC**, **JPN**, **CHN**)
  - Decrease in catches from 2017 for all other LL types (fresh, swordfish)

---

# Summary of fishery trends by fishery group

### Artisanal line fisheries

  - Trends similar to those identified for LL fisheries
  - All major contributors in a phase of slight contraction
  - 
  
### All other artisanal fisheries
  
  - Generally stable trends since 2017
  - Marked decrease in catches from **IRN** gillnets from 2018
  - **IDN** catch levels (gillnet and liftnet) decreased after peak in 2020

# Summary of reporting quality - NC


- _Generally_ increasing trend in quality levels from 2010 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2010]$GOOD_PERC`%) to 2018 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2018]$GOOD_PERC`%), with a slight decrease from 2020 (`r quality_nc[YEAR == 2020]$GOOD_PERC`%, CoViD effect?)
- Quality driven by _industrial_ fisheries
- Estimations performed for **_NEI_** and **IDN** fleets
- Implementation of PSM contributed to Improvements in reporting
- Reporting issues for several **coastal fisheries** 
    + **MDG**, **MOZ**, **TZA**, **IDN**: estimated by the Secretariat in recent years
    + **SOM**, **YEM**, **ERI**: complete lack of reporting
-	**PS** fishery of **EU,Spain**: species composition in 2018
- **PS** fishery of **Seychelles**: similar issues potentially detected for 2021
